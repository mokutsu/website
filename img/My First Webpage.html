      <p>
        I fell in love with home decor from HGTV. I began collecting pictures on Instagram for my home sweet home one day. I want a small, cozy traditional with a twist of the French European charm townhouse with herringbone hardwood floors, crown molding, exposed wood beams, and stylish accessories.

<h2> A Dog Mom's Life </h2>
<p class="dog-content">
  I've always wanted a dog growing up. The idea of a dog's unconditional love and companion ship as i go through life is so rewarding. Hey, if i never get married and become a mom, at least i became a dog mom right? Finally, Pinky, named after the dog of my favourite girl band S.H.E entered my life on Mother's Day 2015. As fate would have it, Pinky turned out to be a maltipoo and she is perfect. She is a human dog, loves food, has a favourite teddy bear, and is the most loving dog i could have asked for. She is far from perfect, her teeth are not straight, she has one pink paw, has separation anxiety, hates car rides and baths, but i still love her. How can you love something so much, my heart flutters everytime I look at her? She sleeps on my left, walks on my left so when she leaves me to cross over to the rainbow bridge, i am going to take a tattoo on my left for her. I only hope she lives a long and happy life so we can go on many, many memories before she walks her last steps on this world.
